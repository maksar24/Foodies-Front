This project is a React-based frontend, built using Vite for fast development and hot module replacement (HMR). It integrates Redux for state management, Axios for handling API requests, and Ant Design (antd) for UI components.

## **Key Features**:
- **Vite**: Minimal setup with lightning-fast HMR and development experience.
- **React**: Core framework for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management to ensure predictable and maintainable application state.
- **Axios**: Simple promise-based HTTP client for API integration.
- **Ant Design**: Beautiful, pre-built UI components for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **ESLint**: Basic linting configuration to maintain code quality and consistency.
