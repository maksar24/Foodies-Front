This project is a React-based frontend, built using Vite for fast development and hot module replacement (HMR). It integrates Redux for state management, Axios for handling API requests, Ant Design (antd) for UI components, and styled-components for custom styling.

## **Key Features**:
- **Vite**: Minimal setup with lightning-fast HMR and development experience.
- **React**: Core framework for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management to ensure predictable and maintainable application state.
- **Axios**: Simple promise-based HTTP client for API integration.
- **Ant Design**: Beautiful, pre-built UI components for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Styled-components**: CSS-in-JS library for dynamic, reusable, and scoped styling.
- **ESLint**: Basic linting configuration to maintain code quality and consistency.
